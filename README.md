### Week 4 Skill Distillery Homework Project

#### Overview
This is a java program for simulating a blackjack game. The user can "buy" chips to bet with while playing hands of blackjack against the dealer.
Once initialized the program will loop prompts for user input until the user exits the program with the corresponding menu option. The program utilizes the shell to display text to the user and take keyboard input. 

The program utilizes many classes as well as Enumerators. Eleven in total organized in four separate packages. There are object classes for Players, Hands, Pots, Cards and Decks. The card class is defined by its Rank and Suit Enumerators. The BlackjackDealer class is a child of the same Player class as the user BlackjackPlayer is derived from but contains more methods as well as a Deck object to interact with. The application class utilizes all of these object classes to create communication interactions with each other in a way that simulates a blackjack game.
